# CHM090Efficacy
Final Code from the CHM090 Efficacy Project

The purpose of this project was to determine how well CHM090 was serving students in the courses for which it was being used as pre-requisite - CHM151, CHM130, and BIO168 - in an effort to determine (1) if CHM090 was actually improving student success and (2) how CHM090 should be improved to better serve students. The code is posted here, but because some of the data files contain student PII, the data has been omitted.  This project was a combination of Python scripting and R scripting.
